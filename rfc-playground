## RFC1 - Hardware Monitor Protocol

This connects a HARDWARE peer to a MONITOR peer.

The HARDWARE peer creates a PUB socket and connects to port 5560 on the MONITOR peer system.
The MONITOR peer creates a SUB socket, subscribes to "" (all data) and binds to port 5560 on all interfaces ("*").

The protocol consists of two messages:

* name/ON - the HARDWARE is in "power on" state 
* name/OFF - the HARDWARE is on "power off" state

Where "name" is a unique name for the HARDWARE node, and "/" indicates a multipart message.

The HARDWARE peer MUST send a state message at regular intervals, e.g. once per second otherwise it's considered gone.


## RFC2 - Alert Gateway Protocol

This connects a MONITOR peer to a GATEWAY peer.

The MONITOR peer creates a PUB socket, subscribes to "" (all data) and connects to port 5561 on the MONITOR peer system.
The GATEWAY peer creates a SUB socket and binds to port 5561 on all interfaces ("*").

The protocol consists of one message:

* name/ALERT/STATE - a specified asset has changed state. This message does not contain further information.

Where "name" is a unique name for the asset, and "/" indicates a multipart message. STATE values "ON", "OFF", "GONE".

The MONITOR peer MUST send a state message at reguar intervals, e.g. once per second otherwise it's considered gone.
