# Problem: naming conventions for "42ity" project

Naming should cover:

 * library name
 * C functions
 * repo / project name
 * package name
 * daemon name
 * cli tool(s) name
 * path names
 * can spill over to systemd unit names (services, timers, etc.) - although several units may be defined for different deliverables of the same source-code repo (e.g. both an agent or server and some house-keeping timer)

# Consolidated naming convention proposal

Building on "fty" and "42ITy" / "42ity"

* every function / classe / structure use the "fty_" prefix
* binaries (daemons / libraries / CLI) use the "42ity-" and remove the "agent-" prefix
* all IPC product specific are out of scope (ipc-data, ipc-lcd-engine, ipc-meta)

# FTY prefix

## Rationale

**FTY** is a shortcut of 42ity, which is short and can be used as C identifier.

The next goal is to remove repetitive and redundant word "agent". It carries little information, plus programname in unix is limited to 15 characters (or at least many programs truncate it internally when processing the names as informative strings), so wasting the first X characters will damage rsyslog filtering for example.

See `bios-agent-nut` and `bios-agent-nut-configurator`. If we'll use longer name (say, `snmp` instead of `nut`), the programname for both agents will be (seem) the same!!

## Example repo

    tree example.git/src/
    example.git/src/
    ├── fty_example_classes.h
    ├── fty_example_selftest
    ├── fty_example_selftest.c
    ├── fty-example
    ├── fty_example.c
    ├── fty-example.cfg.in
    ├── fty-example.service.in
    ├── fty_example_server.c
    ├── libfty_example.la
    └── libfty_example.pc.in

NOTE: Make up the mind about underscores vs. dashes, the tree above is an example fo why mixing them is ugly to see and maintain and code.

NOTE: MVY: I see no issue. Binary names, configuration files and everything visible to end user have dashes. Source code files are with underscores, so they're compatible with C compilers. There's only one exception, the dash in library name - frankly I've no preference, buty it'd be trivial to fix zproject to do that.

## C functions

    fty_proto_t *msg = fty_proto_new ();
    zactor_t *server = zactor_new (fty_rt_server, NULL);
    zmsg_t *msg = fty_smtp_encode (uuid, to, subject, body, NULL);

 * eipi_

# Ideas from AQU

* Don’t touch binaries names (apps and shared libs), apart if they have "bios" in the name
* Modify only package names to expose "42ity", including packages descriptions
* Rule:
  Lower case "42ity" in the names, upper case "42ITy" for the descriptions and texts
** Example:
*** agent-asset -> 42ity-agent-asset:
**** Description: 42ITy - Assets management agent
*** core -> 42ity-core:
**** Description: 42ITy - Core functionality
*** libbiosproto -> lib42ityproto
**** maybe the "proto" part should be reworded?! -> lib42ity-agent or lib42ity-protocol 
** system units:
*** probably good to expose 42ity in these names... to be discussed 
** repository names:
*** not sure if we need to rename to include 42ity (lower case, as for the package name), probably not (apart from libbiosproto...)

# Ideas from Jana:
* repository
** complete name without any abbreviations or agent- prefix
** rename epfl to proxy
* agent -> <repo>-agent
* server -> <repo>-server
* CLI -
    ** etn-pi-<name>
    ** etn-pmi-<name>
    ** etn-ipc-<name>
    ** etnipc-<name>
    ** eipi-<name>
** (from Karol)
    *** etn_<name>_cli
    *** joe_<name>_cli
